OpenSource multiplayer and network messaging for CoronaSDK, Moai, Gideros & LÖVE

Battle-tested and production ready. Handling thousands of CCU (concurrent users), serving hundreds of thousands multiplayer games daily, routing hundreds of messages per second, with months of uptime.

* Connections are routed through socket server with minimum latency, ideal for action games.
* Simple interface. Publish/subscribe paradigm in action.
* Server written on blazing fast Nodejs.
* Zero dependency. Works out of the box, no NPM ecosystem required.
* Socket connections, works great through any NAT (local area network), messages delivery is reliable and fast.
* Low CPU and memory footprint

Repo includes server code (so you can use your own server) and CoronaSDK/Moai/Gideros/LÖVE client. More clients to come.
You can test on my server, credentials are hardcoded in demo project!

Lua code may serve as an example of how LuaSocket library works.


How to use it
------------

START SERVER
```bash
        $ nodejs node.js
```

INITIALIZE
```lua
        hub = noobhub.new({ server = "127.0.0.1"; port = 1337; });
```

SUBSCRIBE TO A CHANNEL AND RECEIVE CALLBACKS WHEN NEW JSON MESSAGES ARRIVE
```lua
        hub:subscribe({
          channel = "hello-world";
        	callback = function(message)

        		if(message.action == "ping")   then
        			print("Pong!")
        		end;

        	end;
        });
```
SAY SOMETHING TO EVERYBODY ON THE CHANNEL
```lua
        hub:publish({
            message = {
                action  =  "ping",
                timestamp = system.getTimer()
            }
        });
```


Clients
------
* CoronaSDK
* Gideros
* Moai
* LÖVE
* Node.js
* PHP (debug console only)

Tests
-----

Simple acceptance test uses Nodejs client to test the server itself:

```bash
    $ ./run-tests.sh
    starting Noobhub server...
    NoobHub on :::1337
    running tests...
    tests ok
```

Getting ready for production use
------------
If you expect more than 1000 concurrent connections, you should increase limits on your server (max open file descriptors,
max TCP/IP connections) and optionally fine-tune your server's TCP/IP stack.
To make sure server process stays alive you migh want to use tools such as forever.js or supervisord.
